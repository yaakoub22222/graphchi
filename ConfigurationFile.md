## Configuration File ##

Directory **conf** contains the configuration file. GraphChi will first look for a file names **graphchi.local.cnf**, and if it does not exist, **graphchi.cnf**. The latter file is in the version management, so it is better to create the local configuration file for your own settings.

The default configuration file has a value for each of the main configuration parameters.

CommandLineParameters override configuration parameters.
